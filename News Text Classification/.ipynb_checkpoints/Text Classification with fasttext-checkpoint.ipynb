    "# Project Notebook: Text Identification with FastText\n",
    "FastText is a popular open-source, free, lightweight library that allows users to learn text representations and perform text classification tasks efficiently. It was developed by Facebook's AI Research (FAIR) lab. FastText is known for its speed and ability to handle large datasets.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "FastText primarily supports supervised learning, where a model is trained on labeled data to make predictions on new, unseen data. However, it doesn't have built-in functionality for unsupervised learning. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm doesn't have labeled data and aims to find patterns or representations within the data.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, you can use FastText for unsupervised tasks by leveraging its ability to learn word embeddings. The unsupervised approach often involves training FastText on a large corpus to learn word representations and then using those embeddings for downstream tasks or analysis.<p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Fasttext is pre trained word vectors on 'Common Crawl' and 'Wikipedia'. We can learn more about fasttext on https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we embark on two distinct projects utilizing FastText - supervised and unsupervised machine learning for text identification. The primary objective is to leverage FastText's capabilities in capturing semantic relationships among words through unsupervised learning, and subsequently, employing it for product category prediction through supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the \"E-commerce Text Classification\" dataset sourced from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/ecommerce-text-classification/data). This dataset contains product descriptions and corresponding categories, serving as the foundation for our exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Projects Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "Our first project involves training a FastText model in an unsupervised manner to capture word similarities within our dataset. The goal is to generate word embeddings that encode semantic relationships, enabling us to measure the similarity between different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning:\n",
    "The second project focuses on supervised learning, where we train a FastText model to predict product categories based on their descriptions. We preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration:**\n",
    "   - Explore the structure and characteristics of the provided dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning:**\n",
    "   - Train a FastText model in an unsupervised manner to capture word similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Supervised Learning:**\n",
    "   - Prepare the data for supervised learning by preprocessing and splitting into training and testing sets.\n",
    "   - Train a FastText model for product category prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Assess the performance of the supervised learning model using relevant metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conclusion and Further Exploration:**\n",
    "   - Summarize the findings and propose potential avenues for further exploration or improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these projects, we aim to demonstrate the versatility of FastText in both unsupervised and supervised contexts for effective text identification and classification.\n"

After preprocessing, the 'Similarity_model' column reveals new associations, highlighting similar terms like 'tablecloth,' 'dining,' and 'placemats.'

    "In FastText, adding a prefix like 'label' to each category and combining it with the text is a formatting requirement for supervised text classification. This prefix helps FastText recognize and distinguish between the category labels and the actual text during training. The combined format ensures that the model understands the association between the provided labels and their corresponding textual descriptions, allowing it to learn and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explored the capabilities of FastText for both unsupervised and supervised machine learning tasks in the context of text identification. FastText demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing word similarities and learning meaningful representations through unsupervised training. Additionally, we utilized a pre-trained FastText model on a generic dataset and later fine-tuned it on an e-commerce dataset for specific applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "We initially examined the word similarities based on a pre-trained FastText model, specifically focusing on the word 'table.' The model successfully identified similar words, such as 'tables' and 'tablecloth,' showcasing its ability to capture semantic relationships. After training the model on our e-commerce dataset, we observed improvements, with the model now associating words like 'dining' and 'placemats,' indicating a better understanding of domain-specific language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning:\n",
    "In the supervised learning phase, we employed FastText to predict product categories based on their descriptions. The model achieved a high precision of approximately 96.8%, indicating its accuracy in categorizing products. Examples of predicting categories for input texts further demonstrated the model's capability to assign relevant labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Areas for Improvement:\n",
    "1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experimenting with different hyperparameter settings during model training can significantly impact performance. Parameters such as epochs, learning rate, and the number of dimensions in word vectors could be fine-tuned for optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset Size:** Increasing the size of the dataset for supervised learning could potentially improve model generalization. A larger and more diverse dataset may capture a broader range of language nuances and improve the model's ability to handle various product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation:** While our model achieved high precision, exploring additional evaluation metrics like recall, F1 score, or utilizing techniques like cross-validation can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Domain-Specific Embeddings:** Consider exploring domain-specific pre-trained embeddings or training embeddings on a larger and more relevant e-commerce dataset. This may further enhance the model's understanding of domain-specific language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing to iterate on these aspects and experimenting with different configurations will likely lead to an even more robust and accurate text identification model."
